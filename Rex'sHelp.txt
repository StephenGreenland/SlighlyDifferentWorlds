+ Problem space is unclear, abilities aren't well defined
+ Punishment for misenterpreting first puzzle is harsh and it's unclear what the player has done wrong
+ Motivation is unclear, what's the thematic reason for doing any of this?
+ It's possible to fireball barriers off-screen, if the player does this in the first area, it's unclear what will solve the barrier in the second level.
+ Movement is slidey
+ Movement control and response changes dramatically alongside level scale change, this should be consistent
++ Input was being received in FixedUpdate, you should use Update for this
++ Input needs to take into account ergonomics of human player- try to separate utility/fire keys and motion control. You should use Input.GetAxis instead of keypresses to support controllers or alternative key setups.
